# Project Title 
Network Design Project for Hospital Management

# Project Overview
This project entails the design of a sophisticated network infrastructure for a hospital, aiming to enhance both internal and external communication efficiency. The network design is tailored to address the specific needs of various hospital areas, ensuring security, functionality, and scalability.

# Project Objectives
1. To develop a secure and scalable network system for different hospital departments.
2. To ensure reliable and efficient communication for both public access and internal operations.
3. To enhance network management and security through segmented network zones.

# Project Scope
The project is divided into six key network areas:
1. **General Ward**: Public access network for patient connectivity, excluding internal communications.
2. **Private Ward**: Network for VIP and cabin services, focusing on privacy and service quality.
3. **Clinical Area**: Restricted network for internal clinical functions, including emergency and operation theaters.
4. **IT Department**: Administrative network for network system management and security.
5. **Entrance & Reception**: Public network for patient and visitor management.
6. **Lobby and Parking**: Outdoor network for CCTV surveillance, parking management, and VIP reception.

# Methodology
- **Network Design Tools**: Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation and design.
- **Diagramming Tools**: yED and Lucida Chart for creating detailed network diagrams.

# Development Phases
1. **Week 1**: Initial Project Discussion and Planning
2. **Week 2**: Project Plan Development
3. **Week 3**: Network Diagram Creation
4. **Week 4**: Project Proposal Preparation
5. **Week 5**: Implementation of General Ward Network
6. **Week 6**: Implementation of Private Ward Network
7. **Week 7**: Implementation of Clinical Area Network
